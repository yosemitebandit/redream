### Algorithm thoughts

1. take input words
2. find keywords (remove prepositions, articles, etc)
3. search within archives for each major keyword -- an action, object, place (individually); this returns one clip per keyword
4. [optional] limit the results to movies less than 3 minutes
5. take random slice of video [optional] need to keep the rhythm of clips -- duration of slice is determined by number of non-keywords in between the keywords, or user-specified weights; keep a muscial time during the cuts
6. [optional] maybe take steps to elongate certain videos to make up for terse dreams
7. [optional] add audio overlay based on other keywords (freemusicarchive.org or archive.org)
8. glue all videos together (randomly or in sequence)
9. return that compressed video back to the website (probably 640 x 480)


### Example dreams

* went to a party people were throwing hats like frisbees, people were 
flying up the houseboat stairs (keywords: frisbees, stairs, spirals)
* I had a dream where I was watching myself in the mirror and I started to age 
right in front of my face. My hair turned white and my face wrinkled. It 
wasn't scary but it was strange (keywords: myself mirror watching age front 
face hair white face wrinkled scary strange)
* I jumped over the fence of my childhood neighborâ€™s backyard and there were 
bright pink, blue and orange snakes. It was very frightening and I quickly 
climbed out. 


### Running a worker

we're using [rq](http://python-rq.org).

    $ cd serve
    $ rqworker


### Testing

test the keyword classifier via nose:

    $ nosetests serve


### Running on the server

it's terrible, but we're just running a bare flask server and the workers
behind screen.
here are some helpful commands:

    $ screen -ls  # view sessions
    $ screen -r  # reattach to a session with tab
    $ [Ctrl-a] [c]   # within screen, create a new window
    $ [Ctrl-a] [n], [Ctrl-a] [p]  # within screen, navigate windows
    $ [Ctrl-a] [[]  # within screen, enable scrolling
    $ [Ctrl-d]  # detach screen session
